In script 'execution_nogenotypes.m' we choose the parameters, call the execution of the simulation, and plot populations evolution.
It is not recomended to average simulations here (put Nsimulations=1) since small deviations of the oscillations can cancell these oscillations on average.

Other Matlab functions are needed to perform the simulation

Logic variables 'showplot' and 'saveplot' allows us to generate and save plots when they are 'true', yet they delay the execution of the simulation.
