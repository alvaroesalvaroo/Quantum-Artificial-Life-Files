In script 'execution_nogenotypes.m' we choose the parameters, call the execution of the simulation, and plot populations evolution.
It is not recomended to average simulations here (put Nsimulations=1) since small deviations of the oscillations can cancell these oscillations on average.

Other Matlab functions are needed to perform the simulation
